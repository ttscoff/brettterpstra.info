### Profile

I'm a writer, podcaster, and software developer with over 25 years of experience in writing, documenting, and marketing software. I've worked in HTML/CSS, JavaScript, C/C++, Ruby, Objective-C, Swift, Python, and more. I have extensive experience writing documentation using Markdown with Git version management and publishing pipelines.

I graduated from the Minneapolis College of Art and Design in 2000, with a BA in Interactive Multimedia (Web Design). After working as Art Director and webmaster for a fashion company and subsequently founding my own advertising firm, I went full-time into web development. I began working for Aol Tech (Engadget, TUAW, Joystiq, Massively) in 2011 and rose to Senior Front-End developer and tech lead for the content division. I left that position after five years to be an independent software developer for seven years before taking on a Developer Relations role at Oracle in 2021.

I am currently working as a Principal Software Developer for Oracle on the Developer Relations team, with a technical writing focus. I maintain my personal projects, including multiple applications and their documentation and support, as well as writing, blogging, and podcasting.

### Skills

Summary
: - HTML, CSS, and responsive web design
- JavaScript, React, jQuery with some experience with other frameworks (Angular, Vue)
- PHP, Ruby, and Python scripting
- Mac and Unix platforms and command line proficiency
- Objective-C, Swift, and Mac development
- Excellent prose and technical writing skills
- Git/GitHub proficiency
- Expert on Markdown

Programming
: I have a core set of languages I consider myself proficient in (Ruby, Objective-C, Swift), and myriad languages I'm comfortable working in and always learning more about. I'm able to pick up a new language quickly as the need arises.

Language
: I have strong English language skills, spoken and written, bridging both grammar and style. My writing is both technical and approachable in nature, and I've been credited by many new programmers with having provided them an accessible entry point to a concept. I internalize any style guide I'm presented with and can easily write for the target publication.

Git/GitHub
: I use Git for version control on all of my projects, and GitHub hosting for [all of my open source work](https://github.com/ttscoff) (and some private repositories). I'm well-versed in command line Git, apps like Tower and GitKraken, and have experience using GitHub Pull Requests, Issues, and Discussions. I also have experience developing GitHub Actions as pipeline for CI/CD and automation.

Leadership
: I work well with others, and naturally take a leadership role. In times when that leadership role has led to a management position, I've done an excellent job of hearing the needs of my reports, guiding them in their projects, and acting as a conduit between upper management and my team to accomplish large goals on time. I have experience with Agile workflows.

: I communicate well, whether in email, 1-on-1, or in meeting settings. I accept criticism, understand goals, and convey my feelings and opinions easily.

: I will say what's on my mind, but I am careful not to hurt others, and am very aware of differing needs within a team. I have often been told after meetings "thank you for saying that, I didn't have the nerve." I wear this as a badge of honor.

Markdown
: I'm extremely proficient in Markdown. I can tell you every difference between MultiMarkdown, Discount, Maruku, Kramdown, PHP Markdown Extra, GitHub Flavored Markdown, and any other flavor of Markdown. I know how to write Markdown that will translate across platforms and processors, and how to leverage the specific strengths of any Markdown processor.

### Activities

Writing
: I've contributed to several major publications, including [O'Reilly's Mac Hacks](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mac-hacks/9781449343453/), and co-authored the interactive books [60 Mac Tips Volumes 1 and 2](http://60tips.com/) for Apple's iBookstore and Vimeo release.

: I blog regularly and have developed an audience (~20k/week) with whom I enjoy interacting. Many of my late-night hacks and projects are documented at [BrettTerpstra.com](https://brettterpstra.com/). I've also published work on The Unofficial Apple Weblog, Macworld (print and web), MacStories, and LifeHacker, as well as contributed to the upcoming Terminus project for Warp.

Coding
: I develop the Mac application [Marked](https://marked2app.com), a tool for authors and bloggers with Markdown preview and text analysis features. 
: I created and maintain [Bunch](https://bunchapp.co), an automation tool for Mac, the [documentation of which](https://bunchapp.co/docs) I am particularly proud. 
: I authored the [nvALT](https://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/) fork of Notational Velocity and am currently working on its successor, [nvUltra](https://nvultra.com/). 
: I spend my free time coding automation and productivity [apps and scripts](https://brettterpstra.com/projects). I have myriad open source tools I've authored and supported, including [Doing](https://github.com/ttscoff/doing) (command line project/time tracking), [mdless](https://github.com/ttscoff/mdless) (a command line Markdown pager), the [MarkdownEditing](https://github.com/ttscoff/MarkdownEditing) package for Sublime Text, and [NA](https://github.com/ttscoff/na_gem) (command line interaction with TaskPaper files). 
: In the process of documenting my projects, I've built helpful tools like [NiftyMenu](https://studio.youtube.com/video/vR-LioIh6EQ/edit) and a Keyboard Maestro macro for [cross-linking Markdown documents](https://brettterpstra.com/2021/09/01/keyboard-maestro-markdown-linking/).
: I love problem solving, and find complex regular expressions a relaxing endeavor.

Music
: I enjoy blending music and technology, and do a lot of home recording. My punk rock tour days are behind me (videos available upon request), but I continue to enjoy the process of composing and the technical details of production.

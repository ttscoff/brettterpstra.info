<h3 id="profile">Profile</h3>

<p>I&#8217;m a writer, podcaster, and software developer with over 25 years of experience in writing, documenting, and marketing software. I&#8217;ve worked in HTML/CSS, JavaScript, C/C++, Ruby, Objective-C, Swift, Python, and more. I have extensive experience writing documentation using Markdown with Git version management and publishing pipelines.</p>

<p>I graduated from the Minneapolis College of Art and Design in 2000, with a BA in Interactive Multimedia (Web Design). After working as Art Director and webmaster for a fashion company and subsequently founding my own advertising firm, I went full-time into web development. I began working for Aol Tech (Engadget, TUAW, Joystiq, Massively) in 2011 and rose to Senior Front-End developer and tech lead for the content division. I left that position after five years to be an independent software developer for seven years before taking on a Developer Relations role at Oracle in 2021.</p>

<p>I am currently working as a Principal Software Developer for Oracle on the Developer Relations team, with a technical writing focus. I maintain my personal projects, including multiple applications and their documentation and support, as well as writing, blogging, and podcasting.</p>

<h3 id="skills">Skills</h3>

<dl>
<dt>Summary</dt>
<dd> - HTML, CSS, and responsive web design</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
<li>JavaScript, React, jQuery with some experience with other frameworks (Angular, Vue)</li>
<li>PHP, Ruby, and Python scripting</li>
<li>Mac and Unix platforms and command line proficiency</li>
<li>Objective-C, Swift, and Mac development</li>
<li>Excellent prose and technical writing skills</li>
<li>Git/GitHub proficiency</li>
<li>Expert on Markdown</li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dt>Programming</dt>
<dd> I have a core set of languages I consider myself proficient in (Ruby, Objective-C, Swift), and myriad languages I&#8217;m comfortable working in and always learning more about. I&#8217;m able to pick up a new language quickly as the need arises.</dd>

<dt>Language</dt>
<dd> I have strong English language skills, spoken and written, bridging both grammar and style. My writing is both technical and approachable in nature, and I&#8217;ve been credited by many new programmers with having provided them an accessible entry point to a concept. I internalize any style guide I&#8217;m presented with and can easily write for the target publication.</dd>

<dt>Git/GitHub</dt>
<dd> I use Git for version control on all of my projects, and GitHub hosting for <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff">all of my open source work</a> (and some private repositories). I&#8217;m well-versed in command line Git, apps like Tower and GitKraken, and have experience using GitHub Pull Requests, Issues, and Discussions. I also have experience developing GitHub Actions as pipeline for CI/CD and automation.</dd>

<dt>Leadership</dt>
<dd> I work well with others, and naturally take a leadership role. In times when that leadership role has led to a management position, I&#8217;ve done an excellent job of hearing the needs of my reports, guiding them in their projects, and acting as a conduit between upper management and my team to accomplish large goals on time. I have experience with Agile workflows.</dd>

<dd> I communicate well, whether in email, 1-on-1, or in meeting settings. I accept criticism, understand goals, and convey my feelings and opinions easily.</dd>

<dd> I will say what&#8217;s on my mind, but I am careful not to hurt others, and am very aware of differing needs within a team. I have often been told after meetings &#8220;thank you for saying that, I didn&#8217;t have the nerve.&#8221; I wear this as a badge of honor.</dd>

<dt>Markdown</dt>
<dd> I&#8217;m extremely proficient in Markdown. I can tell you every difference between MultiMarkdown, Discount, Maruku, Kramdown, PHP Markdown Extra, GitHub Flavored Markdown, and any other flavor of Markdown. I know how to write Markdown that will translate across platforms and processors, and how to leverage the specific strengths of any Markdown processor.</dd>

<dd> I created and maintain <a href="https://bunchapp.co">Bunch</a>, an automation tool for Mac, the <a href="https://bunchapp.co/docs">documentation of which</a> I am particularly proud.</dd>

<dd> I authored the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/">nvALT</a> fork of Notational Velocity and am currently working on its successor, <a href="https://nvultra.com/">nvUltra</a>.</dd>

<dd> I spend my free time coding automation and productivity <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects">apps and scripts</a>. I have myriad open source tools I&#8217;ve authored and supported, including <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/doing">Doing</a> (command line project/time tracking), <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/mdless">mdless</a> (a command line Markdown pager), the <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/MarkdownEditing">MarkdownEditing</a> package for Sublime Text, and <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/na_gem">NA</a> (command line interaction with TaskPaper files).</dd>

<dd> In the process of documenting my projects, I&#8217;ve built helpful tools like <a href="https://studio.youtube.com/video/vR-LioIh6EQ/edit">NiftyMenu</a> and a Keyboard Maestro macro for <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2021/09/01/keyboard-maestro-markdown-linking/">cross-linking Markdown documents</a>.</dd>

<dd> I love problem solving, and find complex regular expressions a relaxing endeavor.</dd>

<dt>Music</dt>
<dd> I enjoy blending music and technology, and do a lot of home recording. My punk rock tour days are behind me (videos available upon request), but I continue to enjoy the process of composing and the technical details of production.</dd>

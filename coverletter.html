<p>My name is Brett Terpstra, and I&#8217;m applying for the job of Senior Documentation Manager. I believe I&#8217;m an excellent candidate as I&#8217;ve been writing technical documents for over 20 years, working with Git/GitHub for 10 years, and have experience at two major corporations (Aol and Oracle) as a team leader.</p>

<p>I currently work as a Principal Software Developer, formerly Principal Technical Writer, at Oracle. I work on the Developer Relations team, advocating for users and providing content and documentation for Oracle Cloud products.</p>

<p>I have excellent writing skills, am highly proficient in Markdown, and have extensive experience working with Git and GitHub. I have natural leadership capabilities, work well with both reports and upper management, and have seen multiple high-pressure projects through to completion, including taking a key role in the relaunch of Engadget.com and a supporting role in the launch of the new developer.oracle.com.</p>

<p>I have developed dozens of automations and processes for technical documentation, ranging from personal projects (I&#8217;ve published multiple applications, commercial and open source) to the entire publishing pipeline for the DevRel team of Oracle.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been in charge of hiring for Aol when looking for new front-end engineers, and screened/interviewed applicants for technical writing positions at Oracle. I&#8217;ve built teams that work well together and accomplish great goals.</p>

<p>I have outstanding communcation skills, both written and in-person, and am known for having a sense of humor while still able to focus on acheiving goals. I&#8217;m adept at handling and providing feedback, both critical and adulatory.</p>
